# DSMAFORNU
A system made by the team DeimosSoft during school to provide a better managment of the personal of the MAFORNU company at Ciudad Guzm√°n, Jalisco

This system was made with Netbeans IDE and uses a mysql database to work. This database is also uploaded in this repository and its name is "RespaldoSinRegistros.sql"
In order to execute this system it is necessary to install mysql directly in the "C disk" trying to have a directory like this: "C:\\mysql\\bin\\mysql" so that  this is
necessary to run the first class of the project called "CreaBDD.java". 
It is also necessary to create a folder and put the "RespaldoSinRegistros.sql" file, like this: C:\\DeimosSoft\\DSMAFORNU\\RespaldoSinRegistros.sql

You can also try it with an eassier way; just downloading the installer in the next link: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmPRXoLY6bUU6mX9Jq1S8ZTfVCK-
This instaler was made using launch4j-3.9 and innosetup-5.5.9

The principal users is "Administrador" and his password is "123"

Notes: 
-This installer only works for Windows 7 or higher and it also needs to have java installed. It does not work with virtual machine.
-The full documentation of the project can also be found in this repository, but due to DeimosSoft team had to deliver this for school and MAFORNU, everything is
in Spanish.
